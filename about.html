      <p>Straight to the Point Archery is a non-profit archery education center founded in 2005 by Giap Nguyen.
        Our state of the art educational and training facility incorporates detailed technical video analysis
        combined with generations of archery experience from certified coaches and instructors.</p>

        <h4>OUR FACILITY</h4>
        <p>Our indoor training facility is equipped with 28 shooting rooms (14 10-yard lanes and 14 20-yard lanes),
          and 2 private coaching rooms. We also have access to 26 additional 20-yard lanes and an outdoor shooting
          field. We offer several types of lessons to accommodate everyone from the first time archer to the
          professional archer. Once set up with proper fitting equipment, each archer will be given the basic
          safety instruction to start and will be introduced to various shooting techniques.</p>

        <h4>OUR EXPERIENCE</h4>
        <p>Lessons are offered by qualified level 1 and level 2 instructors and have met the safety requirements of
          the USA Archery (USAA). Our instructors also have extensive knowledge of the most advanced archery equipment
          and all forms of archery from the traditional long bow to the modern compound. Straight to the Point Archery
          also has specific instructors for recreational archery, competitive archery and bow hunting.</p>
        <p>Straight to the Point Archery has an excellent network of contacts with the USA Archery (USAA), Washington
          State Archery Association (WSAA), Washington State Bow Hunters (WSB), National Field Archery Association (NFAA)
          and many more national and state archery associations. These partnerships allow you to feel confident in our
